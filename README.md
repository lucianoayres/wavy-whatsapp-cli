## Installation

### Using Mage

This project uses [Mage](https://magefile.org/) for its build system.

1. **Install Mage** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   go install github.com/magefile/mage@latest
   ```

2. **Build the tool**:

   ```bash
   mage build
   ```

   This will create `bin/wavy` executable.

3. **Install the tool system-wide** (optional):

   ```bash
   mage install
   ```

   This will:

   - Copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin/wavy`
   - Create the required config directories at `~/.config/wavy/` and `~/.local/share/wavy/`

## Usage

**WhatsApp connection setup**

1. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   wavy setup
   ```

2. A QR code will be generated and displayed in your image viewer.
3. On your phone, open WhatsApp and navigate to
   **Settings > Linked Devices > Link a Device**
4. Scan the QR code on your computer screen.
5. Once pairing is successful, WhatsApp will confirm the new device is connected. You're now authenticated and ready to send messages.
6. In your terminal, press **Ctrl+C** to exit the setup script.

### Checking if a number is on WhatsApp

```bash
wavy check +1234567890
```

Or using flags:

```bash
wavy check --phone +1234567890
```

### Listing your WhatsApp groups

```bash
wavy groups
```

This will show all groups you're a member of, including their group IDs which you need for sending messages to groups.

### Sending Messages

#### To a contact:

```bash
wavy send +1234567890 "Hello from CLI"
```

Or using flags:

```bash
wavy send --to +1234567890 --msg "Hello from CLI"
```

#### To a group:

```bash
wavy send 123456789@g.us "Hello group from CLI"
```

You must use the exact group ID from the `wavy groups` command.

#### Additional options:

- `--debug` - Enable verbose debug output
- `--wait N` - Wait N seconds for message confirmation (default: 5)

Example:

```bash
wavy send --to +1234567890 --msg "Hello with debug" --debug --wait 10
```

## Data Storage

All wavy data is stored according to the XDG Base Directory Specification:

- Configuration: `~/.config/wavy/`
- Data (including WhatsApp session): `~/.local/share/wavy/`

## Viewing WhatsApp Contact Data

The WhatsApp session data is stored in a SQLite database at `~/.local/share/wavy/client.db`. You can inspect this database to view your contacts and other information:

### Installing SQLite CLI

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install sqlite3

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install sqlite

# For macOS
brew install sqlite
```

### Viewing Contact Data

1. Open the database:

   ```sql
   sqlite3 ~/.local/share/wavy/client.db
   ```

2. View available tables:

   ```sql
   .tables
   ```

3. View your contacts:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM whatsmeow_contacts;
   ```

4. View specific contact information:

   ```sql
   SELECT jid, name, first_name, push_name FROM whatsmeow_contacts;
   ```

5. Count your contacts:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM whatsmeow_contacts;
   ```

6. Find a specific contact by name:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM whatsmeow_contacts WHERE name LIKE '%John%';
   ```

7. Exit SQLite:

   ```
   .exit
   ```

### Using SQLite in Script Mode

You can also query the database directly from the command line:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/wavy/client.db "SELECT jid, name FROM whatsmeow_contacts"
```

## Maintenance

Additional Mage commands available:

- `mage clean` - Remove build artifacts
- `mage uninstall` - Completely remove wavy from your system
- `mage test` - Run tests
- `mage check` - Run linters and static analysis

## Testing

This project includes unit tests to verify functionality. You can run tests using Mage:

### Running Basic Tests

Run all tests:

```bash
mage test
```

### Running Tests with Verbose Output

For more detailed test results:

```bash
mage testVerbose
```

### Generate Test Coverage Report

Generate coverage report (HTML format):

```bash
mage testCoverage
```

This creates a coverage report at `coverage/coverage.html` that you can open in a browser.

## Git Hooks

This project uses [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes.

### Setup

1. Install Lefthook:

   ```bash
   go install github.com/evilmartians/lefthook@latest
   ```

2. Install the Git hooks:

   ```bash
   lefthook install
   ```

### What it does

- Runs `go vet`, `gofmt`, and `go test` on commit
- Runs `go test` on push

The full configuration is available in the [lefthook.yml](./lefthook.yml) file at the project root.

You can also run the hooks manually:

```bash
lefthook run pre-commit
lefthook run pre-push
```

### Running All Tasks

Run formatting, static analysis, tests and build in one command:

```bash
mage all
```

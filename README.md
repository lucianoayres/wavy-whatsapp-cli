## Installation

### Using Mage

This project uses [Mage](https://magefile.org/) for its build system.

1. **Install Mage** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   go install github.com/magefile/mage@latest
   ```

2. **Build the tool**:

   ```bash
   mage build
   ```

   This will create `bin/wavy` executable.

3. **Install the tool system-wide** (optional):

   ```bash
   sudo mage install
   ```

   This will:

   - Copy the binary to `/usr/local/bin/wavy`
   - Create the required config directories at `~/.config/wavy/` and `~/.local/share/wavy/`

## Usage

**WhatsApp connection setup**

1. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   wavy setup
   ```

2. A QR code will be generated and displayed in your image viewer.
3. On your phone, open WhatsApp and navigate to
   **Settings > Linked Devices > Link a Device**
4. Scan the QR code on your computer screen.
5. Once pairing is successful, WhatsApp will confirm the new device is connected. Youâ€™re now authenticated and ready to send messages.
6. In your terminal, press **Ctrl+C** to exit the setup script.

### Checking if a number is on WhatsApp

```bash
wavy check +1234567890
```

Or using flags:

```bash
wavy check --phone +1234567890
```

### Listing your WhatsApp groups

```bash
wavy groups
```

This will show all groups you're a member of, including their group IDs which you need for sending messages to groups.

### Sending Messages

#### To a contact:

```bash
wavy send +1234567890 "Hello from CLI"
```

Or using flags:

```bash
wavy send --to +1234567890 --msg "Hello from CLI"
```

#### To a group:

```bash
wavy send 123456789@g.us "Hello group from CLI"
```

You must use the exact group ID from the `wavy groups` command.

#### Additional options:

- `--debug` - Enable verbose debug output
- `--wait N` - Wait N seconds for message confirmation (default: 5)

Example:

```bash
wavy send --to +1234567890 --msg "Hello with debug" --debug --wait 10
```

## Data Storage

All wavy data is stored according to the XDG Base Directory Specification:

- Configuration: `~/.config/wavy/`
- Data (including WhatsApp session): `~/.local/share/wavy/`

## Viewing WhatsApp Contact Data

The WhatsApp session data is stored in a SQLite database at `~/.local/share/wavy/client.db`. You can inspect this database to view your contacts and other information:

### Installing SQLite CLI

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install sqlite3

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install sqlite

# For macOS
brew install sqlite
```

### Viewing Contact Data

1. Open the database:

   ```bash
   sqlite3 ~/.local/share/wavy/client.db
   ```

2. View available tables:

   ```sql
   .tables
   ```

3. View your contacts:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM whatsmeow_contacts;
   ```

4. View specific contact information:

   ```sql
   SELECT jid, name, first_name, push_name FROM whatsmeow_contacts;
   ```

5. Count your contacts:

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM whatsmeow_contacts;
   ```

6. Find a specific contact by name:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM whatsmeow_contacts WHERE name LIKE '%John%';
   ```

7. Exit SQLite:

   ```
   .exit
   ```

### Using SQLite in Script Mode

You can also query the database directly from the command line:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/.local/share/wavy/client.db "SELECT jid, name FROM whatsmeow_contacts"
```
